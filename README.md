## RentACar

This is A Simple CRUD of Python GUI with the help of tkinter module. I Think This Is Only Useful For Manage Payment Transactions Of The Rental Car. Still No Dashboard Graphic No Car Image And So Much More 
The Feature Included:

1. Show Data Payment Of Rental Car Whether Show All Or By ID Person.
2. Input Data With Some Filter So There is No Wrong Input Type.
3. Add Data Into Data Payment with filter ID to make sure there is no same ID in the data.
4. Edit Data And Delete Data.

Extract The Zip File And Run Exe File Inside The Folder
